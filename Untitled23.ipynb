            "\n",
            "1. **Stay calm**: Take slow, deep breaths and try to relax. Panic can make things worse.\n",
            "2. **Find a safe place**: Get to a quiet, comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed.\n",
            "3. **Bend over**: Slightly bend your knees and lean forward, trying to get your head down towards your knees. This can help ease the pressure in your stomach.\n",
            "4. **Drink some water**: If you can stomach it, try drinking small amounts of water (about 1/2 cup or 120 ml). This can help flush out your system and settle your stomach. Avoid drinking too quickly or too much, as this can make things worse.\n",
            "5. **Avoid triggering foods**: If you know that certain foods or drinks often make you feel queasy, try to avoid them. Common culprits include greasy or spicy foods, strong-smelling foods, or foods that are high in sugar or fat.\n",
            "6. **Get some fresh air**: If you're indoors, open a window or take a quick walk outside to get some fresh air. This can help clear your head and make you feel a bit brighter.\n",
            "7. **Try some ginger**: Ginger has natural anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe an upset stomach. Try drinking ginger tea, eating ginger candies, or adding fresh ginger to your food.\n",
            "8. **Rest and relax**: Give your body a break and take some time to rest. Lie down in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and try to relax. Avoid stimulating activities, like watching TV or playing video games, as these can make things worse.\n",
            "9. **Seek medical attention if needed**: If your symptoms are severe, prolonged, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, or bloody stools, seek medical attention. Always consult with a healthcare professional if you're unsure about your symptoms or if they're impacting your daily life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, if you're experiencing persistent or severe symptoms, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.\n",
